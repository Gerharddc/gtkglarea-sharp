These examples are a playground for the GtkGLAreaSharp library.  If
you want to try something with the library, but do not have the time
or energy to maintain a project, consider creating and maintaining an
example instead.

Some of the examples depend on libraries in the examples/util/,
examples/shapes/ and/or examples/glade/ directories.  If you change
code there, you may need to re-run 'make' from the examples/ directory
in order to re-build the .dll files.

To run the examples, issue the command 'make run' from any of the
example directories.
