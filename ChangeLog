	* examples/rotate-buttons/Teapot.cs
	- Copied from ../shared
	- Will be merged back in after changes are complete to new code
	- Teapot is now implements IGLObject and inherits from GLObjectBase
	- The teapot is drawn and cached by calling Init()
	- We now know how to Draw() ourselves.
	* examples/rotate-buttons/Rotation.cs
	- copied from ../shared
	- Will be merged back in after changes are complete to new code
	- This is a convenient way to refer to a clockwise or c-clockwise rotation in any direction
	* IGLObject.cs
	- This is an interface intended to make GL Object creation easier: Today, Teapots.  Tomorrow the world.  Or quake modles, or whatever.
	* examples/rotate-buttons/ObjectRotationButton.cs
	- This is a widget that inherits from Gtk.Button.  It rotates a GLObject  in a GtkGL.Rotation direction when the button is clicked.
	- It is also the next file to get some love from yours truly
	* examples/rotate-buttons/GtkGLObjectBase.cs
	- This is where methods common to all GLObjects will be implemented
	- Also, common member variables are defined here
	* examples/rotate-buttons/Makefile.am
	- added rotateButtonTest.exe target
	* examples/rotate-buttons/rotateButtonTest.md[ps]
	- created MonoDevelop solution.  I don't think it works right now, but I will be maing it work in the futrue
	* GLWidget.cs
	- Copied from ../shared
	- Will be merged back in after changes are complete to new code
	- now inherits from GLArea
	- we are now calling Teapot.Init() in order to build the teapot
	- we are now calling Teapot.Draw() in order to draw the teapot
	- GLWidget is now a GLArea, so we now use glw instead of glw.glArea
	- there is a control widget.  Did I mention I updated ../common/glwidget.glade ?

	* examples/trackball/shapes.cs:
	- depricated this file.  Soon it will be svn rm'd
	- Broke up the content into examples/common/GlWidget.cs, TrackballWidget.cs and trackballTest.cs
	* examples/trackball/Makefile.am:
	- Corrected the all: target
	- made the trackballTest.exe target work
	- fixed EXTRA_DIST and CLEANFILES
	* examples/common/glwidget.glade:
	- changed from glwidgets to glwidget
	- removed silly frame
	- removed statusbar
	* examples/common/GLWidget.cs:
	- created a connectHandlers() method that the handler connection code lives in now
	- added a link to the gluPerspective() man page
	- made OnExposed() a protected method so GLWidget's derived classes can remove it from the event queue
	- shapeList is now protected so derived classes can fiddle with it
	* examples/glade/glwidget.glade
	- moved the file to common/glwidget.glade
	* examples/glade/Makefile.am:
	- changed glwidget.glade to ../shared/glwidget.glade
	* examples/trackball/trackballTest.cs:
	- simple wrapper around TrackballWidget.cs
