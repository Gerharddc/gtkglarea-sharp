- GLObjectBase's rotate rendering was broken when the scale issue was
  resolved.  This was probably caused by recent changes to
  GtkGL.TransformationMatrix GtkGL.GLObjectBase.TransMatrix in
  examples/util/GLObjectBase.cs

- Make a 2-stage build system.  One, using autotools and gapi, to
  create gtkglarea/generated/*.cs and one, using Prebuild, to create
  various build systems for the widget

- make sure the .dll.config file gets installed to the correct directory

- in the rotate-buttons example non-numeric values should be stricken
  and replaced with the previous value

- Janne's LWO loader code should be used to create a new example for
  loading lightwave models

- Speak with John Carmack and Id about the potential of letting me use
  one of their .mdl or .md3 files in a model-loading example

- build an extrude example

- build an object drag example

- build a user-driven cube creation example
