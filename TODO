- Get Triangle and Square objects drawing themselves correctly

- Re-factor Euler angle stuff into the rotation-button test and out of
the GLObjectBase and IGLObject

- in the rotate-buttons example, modification of the entry fields
  should rotate the object to the desired angle
  * non-numeric values should be stricken and replaced with the
    previous value

- the common code in the examples/rotate-buttons example directory
  should be merged back into examples/common
  * and then that code should be used to re-implement the glade,
    trackball and NeHe examples

- Janne's LWO loader code should be used to create a new example for
  loading lightwave models

- Speak with John Carmack about the potential of letting me use one of
id's .mdl or .md3 files in a model-loading example
