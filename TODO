- Find a way around the gimbal lock problems in rotation-buttons
example

- in the rotate-buttons example, modification of the entry fields
  should rotate the object to the desired angle
  * non-numeric values should be stricken and replaced with the
    previous value

- the common code in the examples/rotate-buttons example directory
  should be merged back into examples/common
  * and then that code should be used to re-implement the glade,
    trackball and NeHe examples

- Janne's LWO loader code should be used to create a new example for
  loading lightwave models
